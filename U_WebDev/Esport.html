		   </div>
		   <div class="ebox">
		   <img src="img/fame.jpg" alt="">
		   <h5>Fame</h5>

		   Tfue and ninja gained millions of followers, they have accumlated more then some professional footballer player

		   </p> 
		   </div>
		   <div class="ebox">
		   <img src="img/school.jpg" alt="">
		   <h5>Scholarships</h5>
		   <P> E sports is jam packed with many teams, these team wants the best players and they will do anything to get them
		   this is a great opporunity for gamers as they recieve shcolorships at teams, which means they get paid to play games and 
		   compete even if they do not win anything </p>
		   </div>
		   <div class="ebox">
		   <img src="img/thinking.jpg" alt="">
		   <h5>Critical thinking</h5>
		   <P> Althought your mum tell you not to play games all the time, Games actually
            have a postiive psychological effect on the brain, as you get use to quick and
            critical thinking.			</p>

		   <div class="ebox">

		   <div class="ebox">
		   <img src="img/com.jpg" alt="">
		   <h5>Part Of A Community</h5>
		   <P> The gaming community is very united and a good thing to be part off
            recently shroud talked his fan out of doing a very upsetting thing. 
            It shown the power of the gaming community and really shows some people 
            just count on watching their E sports inspiration everyday.			</p>

		   <h5>Jobs?</h5>
		   <P> Yes! most are suprised at this benefit
            but if the industry is growing it creates jobs, for example a fornite player 
            who could'nt qualify for the tournament commentated instead. Also becoming an 
            agent is common to scout new talens. Their are various jobs available as the 
            industry is so big.			</p>
		   </div>
		   <div class="ebox">
		   <img src="img/nerds.jpg" alt="">
		   <h5>Nerds?</h5>
		   <P> Yes gamers are assumed to be nerds by society, but if your a E sports pro you have to be able
            to communicate efficently and very quickly, which helps build people skills.		   </p>
