# JavaFX-Game
This game was created for the Design Patterns module in my second year of university.

I learned about the different categories of Design Patterns :
- Structural 
- Creational
- Behavioural

I implemented the following patterns into my game :
- Singleton 
- Factory
- MVC
- Object Pool

I have included a report that justifies my selection of design patterns

I have also included a Jar file to run the game.

I achieve a grade of 77% in this game.
