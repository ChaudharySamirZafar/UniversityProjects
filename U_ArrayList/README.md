# Data Structures & Algorithms
This was a project made for a module in my second year of university.
The general idea of the project was :
- To create my own data structure
- Implement that data structure into a to do list Application

I had a choice out of the following data structures:
- Array List
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Queue

I have attached a Word Document that runs through my justification for picking an ArrayList.

I achieved 91% for this assignment.
